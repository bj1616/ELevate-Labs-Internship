## Task 4---> Dashboard Design

*In this task, I Have to make a dashboard which results into the actionable insights helping the industry in making the well informwed decisions.*

* The actionable insights of this dashboards are:

## Task 5---> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* In this task, I have to find out the key insights from the datasets of own choice.*

* The actionable insights of this EDA are:

*1) As this Insights shows us that Highest death count on a single day happened in "Americas" due to Covid-19 with the death count of 148011,Second highest is the "Europe" With 45844 deaths in particular day.*

*3) If we look at tha data then we come to know that on an avg. "South East asia" has a highest death rates.*

*4) The ratio of Death_to_Recovered is high for the "Europe" which means it has higher death rates compared to recovered.*

*5) We can See that on an average the recovery rate of Americas are very high compared to other countries.*

## Task 6--> Sales Data Analysis Using SQL

* In this task, I have to explore the various functions of sql such as distinct(),extract(),groupby(),orderby() and limit() by performing following tasks on the sales data.*

*a.Use EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) for month.*

*b.GROUP BY year/month.*
